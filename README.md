#### Additional Notes
I have tried to keep the design simple, with a white background (followed my majority of popular e-commerce websites). More focus has been put on the interactive aspects with a sorting button (which can sort on basis of price, and the ratings of the item), and a handy and responsive search bar (for quick searching functionality). 
P.S. :- Added Wingman's favicon for a great look :)
